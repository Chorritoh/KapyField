# KapyHub

KapyHub is a Roblox project that allows me to put together several codes for several games made by myself (roubloxsaa), it is based on a modified version of the RayField library and other libraries for slightly less important things such as functions for the codes for the games.

I really worked very hard for this, so I ask you not to steal any code created by me, obviously you are allowed to steal the modified version of RayField from me, because I don't own RayField, I only modified it and also the less important libraries, but the codes for The games are my property and were made by me.

This was originally just a basic script for the game Michael Zombies, but I decided to turn it into a "Hub", which is basically a script for several games, so if by any chance the creator of Michael Zombies sees this, this is your fault ðŸ˜ˆ, Thank you for reading. ðŸ˜Š
